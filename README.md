# Shell Sort Algorithm Visualization
Shell Sorting Algorithm Animations 

[Shellsort](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shellsort), also known as the **diminishing increment sort**, is one of the oldest sorting algorithms, named after its inventor Donald. L. Shell (1959). 

The idea is:
- calculate gaps;
- starting from the beginning of the list;
- change their positions if they are not in the right order;
- continue until element on the left is smaller than current element;
- repeat with the smaller gap.
